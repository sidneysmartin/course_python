# Assignment (=) Operator
x = 10 # Assigns the value 10 to the variable x

# Addition Assignment (+=) Operator
x += 5 # Equivalent to x = x + 5
print(x) # Output: 15

# Subtraction Assignment (-=) Operator
y = 20
y -= 2 # Equivalent to y = y - 2
print(y) # Output: 18

# Multiplication Assignment (*=) Operator
z = 5
z *= 3 # Equivalent to z = z * 3
print(z) # Output: 15

# Division Assignment (/=) Operator
a = 10
a /= 2 # Equivalent to a = a / 2
print(a) # Output: 5.0

# Exponentiation Assignment (**=) Operator
b = 2
b **= 3 # Equivalent to b = b ** 3
print(b) # Output: 8

# Modulus Assignment (%=) Operator
c = 10
c %= 3 # Equivalent to c = c % 3
print(c) # Output: 1
