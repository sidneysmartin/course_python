# OOP?

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It is a way of structuring and designing code to model real-world entities and their interactions.

## In Simple Terms

#### OOP is a programming style that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes.

#### 1. Inheritance
# Inheritance?

## Definition

#### Inheritance is the concept of allowing a new class (called the derived class or subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (called the base class or superclass). It enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes where a subclass can reuse and extend the functionality of its superclass.

## Purpose

#### The primary purpose of inheritance is to promote code reuse, organization, and the creation of a class hierarchy. It allows the derived (children) class to inherit attributes and methods from the base (parent) class.

## Implementation

#### Inheritance is implemented by specifying the base (parent) class in the definition of the derived (children) class. The derived class inherits attributes and methods from the base class and can provide its own implementations or extend the functionality. The super() function is often used to call methods from the base class. Inheritance facilitates the construction of software systems with a modular and extensible structure, where common functionality is defined in the base class, and specialized features are added in the derived classes.


#### 2. Polymorphism
# Duck Typing?

### Duck typing means that we don't care about what type of object we have, as long as it supports the methods or behaviors we need. So, if an object has a certain method or behavior, we can use it as if it were the type of object we expect, even if it's not exactly that type

#### 3. Encapsulation

# Encapsulation?

#### Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It involves restricting direct access to some of an object's components and only exposing what is necessary.

## Purpose

#### The primary purpose of encapsulation is to hide the internal state and implementation details of an object and to provide a controlled interface for interacting with the object.

## Implementation

#### Encapsulation is often achieved by using private and protected access modifiers. Attributes and methods can be marked as private (using a double underscore \__) or protected (using a single underscore _), limiting direct access from outside the class.
